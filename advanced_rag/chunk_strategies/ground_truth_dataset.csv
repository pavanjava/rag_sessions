The term \n""global climate"" encompasses the planet\'s overall weather patterns, including temperature, \nprecipitation, and wind patterns, over an extended period. Over the past century, human \nactivities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly \ncontributed to climate change. \nHistorical Context \nThe Earth\'s climate has changed throughout history. Over the past 650,000 years, there have \nbeen seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about \n11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and human civilization. \nMost of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\'s orbit that \nchange the amount of solar energy our planet receives. During the Holocene epoch, which \nbegan at the end of the last ice age, human societies flourished, but the industrial era has seen \nunprecedented changes. \nModern Observations \nModern scientific observations indicate a rapid increase in global temperatures, sea levels, \nand extreme weather events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has \ndocumented these changes extensively. Ice core samples, tree rings, and ocean sediments \nprovide a historical record that scientists use to understand past climate conditions and \npredict future trends. The evidence overwhelmingly shows that recent changes are primarily \ndriven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases. \nChapter 2: Causes of Climate Change \nGreenhouse Gases \nThe primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the \natmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous \noxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, creating a ""greenhouse effect."" This effect is essential \nfor life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human \nactivities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate. \nFossil Fuels \nBurning fossil fuels for energy releases large amounts of CO2.

Vulnerable populations, including the elderly, \nchildren, and outdoor workers, are particularly at risk. Heat mitigation strategies, such as \ncooling centers and public health campaigns, are essential. \nVector-Borne Diseases \nClimate change affects the distribution and prevalence of vector-borne diseases, such as \nmalaria, dengue fever, and Lyme disease. Warmer temperatures and changing precipitation \npatterns can expand the habitats of disease-carrying insects, increasing the risk of outbreaks. \nIntegrated pest management and disease surveillance are critical for prevention and control. \nRespiratory and Cardiovascular Diseases \nAir pollution, exacerbated by climate change, contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular \ndiseases. Increased levels of ground-level ozone and particulate matter can worsen conditions \nlike asthma and heart disease. Reducing emissions from vehicles, industries, and power \nplants improves air quality and public health. \nFood and Water Security \nClimate change affects food production and water availability, impacting nutrition and health. \nDroughts, floods, and changing growing seasons can reduce crop yields and disrupt food \nsupply chains. Ensuring food and water security requires resilient agricultural practices, \nefficient water management, and emergency preparedness. \nHealth Adaptation Strategies \nPublic Health Infrastructure \nStrengthening public health infrastructure is vital for adapting to climate change.
